A singly threaded garbage collector generic across types implementing the 'Trace' trait (simple example in main.rs). Objects are accessed through the smart pointers 'GcRef' and 'GcRefMut'. Garbage collection is implemented with a mark and sweep algorithm, and is triggered on a time interval that is by default five seconds. Collection is only triggered when certain methods (eg. add) are used on the Gc object.
